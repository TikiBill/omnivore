Omnivore is a cross-platform app for modern hardware (running Linux, OS X and
Windows) to operate on executables or disk images of Atari 8-bit and Apple ][ machines.

It is designed for reverse engineering, to understand code for which the source has been lost. It was the tool than Kevin Savetz and I used to reverse engineer the `Atari 8-bit version of Jumpman <http://playermissile.com/jumpman/>`_. We understand the source `almost completely now <http://playermissile.com/jumpman/notes.html>`_, and through this I was able to add a `full graphical level editor <omnivore.jumpman.html>`_.

Thanks to Kevin Savetz of the `ANTIC <http://ataripodcast.com>`_ and `Eaten by
a Grue <http://monsterfeet.com/grue/>`_ podcasts, and Wade of the `Inverse
ATASCII <https://inverseatascii.info>`_ and `1632 Atari PodcaST
<https://1632podcast.info/>`_ podcasts for early testing and feedback. Using
Omnivore's `map editor <omnivore.map_edit.html>`_, Wade created the first new
map for the classic game Getaway!, and a Getaway! level design template (and
tester executable) is included with Omnivore.
