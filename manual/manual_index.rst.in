Omnivore is a cross-platform app for modern hardware (running Linux, OS X and
Windows) to operate on executables or disk images of Atari 8-bit and Apple ][ machines.

It is designed for reverse engineering, to understand code for which the source has been lost. It was the tool than Kevin Savetz and I used to reverse engineer the `Atari 8-bit version of Jumpman <https://playermissile.com/jumpman/>`_. We understand the source almost completely now, and through this I was able to add a `full graphical level editor <omnivore.jumpman.html>`_.

Wade of the `Inverse ATASCII Podcast <http://inverseatascii.info>`_
